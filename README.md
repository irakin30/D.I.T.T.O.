# DITTO - Digital Image Tagging and Trading-Card Observer 

[Insert Ditto image Here]

### Group Members: Sam Lin, Devin Chen, Istab Rakin 

## Short Introduction 
Ditto is inspired by TAG grading. It is a trading card evaluation company that 
evaluates the quality of Pokémon cards and many different types of trading 
cards. The purpose of this project is to create a replica of TAG’s grading 
process and allow users to scan their own cards before evaluations through TAG 
by allowing the consumer to take a picture of their card and through some
computer vision algorithms, detect and trace defects to output a score on a 
scale of 1.0 through 10.0 (with 10 being the best). 

## Caveats 
Since Image Tagging usually requires a ring light and multiple cameras at 
different angles, we physically won't have as much data to work off of. So, this
would be a proof-of-concept for now (can we make a tagging system using easily 
accessible hardware) and fine tune it to an acceptable level?
